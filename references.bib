	abstract = {The   Model-Driven   Architecture   is   an  initiative  by  the  Object
Management   Group  to  automate  the  generation  of  platform-specific
models  from  platform-  independent  models.  While  there  exist  some
well-established  standards  for  modeling  platform  models,  there  is
currently  no  matured foundation for specifying transformations between
such  models.  In  this  paper,  we  propose a possible taxonomy for the
classification  of  several  existing  and proposed model transformation
approaches.  The  taxonomy  is described with a feature model that makes
the  different  design choices for model transformations explicit. Based
on  our  analysis, we propose a few major categories in which most model
transformation approaches fit.},
